# Homework #3 - POLITICAL REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN WORLDWIDE

[Link to the dataviz we study](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w30)

## **1. Critical look**
First we will answer the following questions as if we were the one who had created this dataviz.
### **Designing the visualisation**
- *What context are you working in ? Any interests at stake ?*
  
We work in effort to realize one of the Union Nation goal which is achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls. 

- *What are your goals: Attention/Understanding/Implication*
  
The goals are multiple. The first goal is **understanding** the data. We want to know which country allows gender equality. Using a map will help us gather with information. A more precise visualisation displayed year by year will enable us to take a look at the evolution of the data.
  
  But the most important goal is **implication.** We want to raise awareness on how political representation of women worldwide is (ie. proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments). Thus, we prove the problem of political representation and ask for actions. 
  
  **Attention** is surely important to get people to look closely at the visualisation. That is why we chose a gradient of color that will be shocking (ie. red).

- *Who is your audience their litteracy and learning types, their needs ?*
  
The audience is every citizen of the world. So we must adapt our visualisation to assure that any litteracy background can understand the message. However, we mostly aim the political class and the executive seniors of bigh companies who should have strong litteracy.

- *What's the main message of your chart or the question you are answering ?*

The main question we want to answer through this chart is what is the evolution of political representation of women in the world? Are we far from gender equality ? Which areas are the most improving ?

### **Implementing the visualisation**
- *What is the type of your visual?*

The type of the first visual declarative. Through a map we will show facts. The type of the second visual is more exploratory. It will allow anyone to dig more deeply into the data year by year to check whether actions have been taken in a particular country.

- *What are the functions of your visualisation ?*

The first visualisation is a map of the world combined with a heatmap displaying the distribution of the political representation of women. 
The second visualisation is a tab also combined with a heatmap to display more precisely year by year the distribution of the polication representation for each country.

- *What are the visual variables you used ?*

-> <u>Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament (%)</u> both displayed by the value or by a color for the heatmap. 

-> <u>Country</u> representing direcly of the map and displayed by a column in the tab. 

-> <u>Year</u> Two maps both represents the situation in 1997 and in 2019. Also, the tab gathers each year in multiple columns.

### **Thoughts**

I think we understand in most case the message of the visualisation. I like the maps that displayed information quickly and efficiently.

As far as color is concerned, I would have added some green to the gradient of color to show when a country has reached the gender equality in the political representation which is the goal of UN.

I don't like the fat table under the map. Because there are some many countries, it would take ages to find a particular country. So I would have merged the tab and the maps dynamically to show the evolution year by year of the data. Otherwise I would have added a searchbar to find a country by its name.

## **3. Make a new proposition [Link to my visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/truong5696/viz/Womeninpolitics_16525689506490/Tableaudebord1)**

## **4. Reflects**

My new proposition is inspired by the original one. I just added a dynamic filter that enables the user to choose the year and the country he wants to study. I also changed the color to emphasize a value when a country has a fair proportion of seats held by women in national parliament. 

The biggest improvement is the flexibility and highlighted value (year and country) offered to the user on the dashboard.
